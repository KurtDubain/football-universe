 * Phase G — injury / suspension engine.

 * This module owns the per-match "did anybody get hurt or banned?" pass that
 * runs after each match window. It is intentionally:
 *
 *   - PURE: input world references are never mutated except via the explicit
 *     `apply*` helpers, which return new arrays + carry the patch back.
 *   - SEEDED: every roll goes through a SeededRNG passed in by the caller.
 *
 * Severity distribution (see {@link rollInjurySeverity}):
 *
 *   minor      60%   1-2 matches
 *   moderate   30%   3-5 matches
 *   major       9%   6-12 matches
 *   long_term   1%   15-25 matches
 *
 * Suspension rules (unified across league + cups, see comments on
 * {@link computeSuspensionFromCounters} and {@link applyDisciplineFromMatch}):
 *
 *   - cumulative yellow count reaches 5 → 1-match ban, counter resets
 *   - direct red card → 2-match ban
 *   - 2nd yellow same match (red coexists with ≥ 2 yellow events) → 1-match
 *   - cumulative red count reaches 2 (rare double-red) → another 1-match
